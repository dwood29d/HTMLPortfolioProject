    <h3>What I can do</h3>
    <p>I'm a newbie. As such, I am using this project as the starting point
    for my Web Design experience. I've got a little experience in Java, HTML, CSS
    and JQuery, as well as a syntax level understanding of Ruby. I plan
    update this site as my skills grow. Check back often!</p>
