    <h3>What I can do</h3>
    <p>I'm a newbie. As such, I am using this project as the starting point
    for my Web Design experience. I've got a little experience in Java, HTML, CSS
    and JQuery, as well as a syntax level understanding of Ruby. I plan
    update this site as my skills grow. Check back often!</p>

    <h3>My Skills</h3>
    <p>I'm a quick study and enjoy the process as much as I do the end result.
    There are many times in which I learn the framework for some new concept
    in passing, and run with it. Because of this, I'm able to learn on my own time.
    This does not, however, mean that I'm afraid to ask questions. I like
    to get all the relevant information to be comfortable doing my job.
    As previously stated, I have knowledge of front end coding
    with these languages:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JQuery</li>
      <li>Javascript</li>
    </ul>
